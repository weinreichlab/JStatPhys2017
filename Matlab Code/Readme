This directory contains all the code used to prepare this manuscript. Of these, 
the following are to be run directly from inside MATLAB:

- BuildKendallTauTable.m, which produces the content for Table 1
- ComputePalmerFig2aTau_b.m, which analyzes the aggregated ranks given in Palmer figure 2a
- DrawPalmerPvalFig.m produces Fig 1c
- DrawResidualVarFigs.m produces Fig S1

The remaining files are subroutines:

- CountPeaks.m contributes to Table 1
- GetResdidualVariance.m is the analytic pipeline itself
- ktaub.m computes the statistic and came from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/11190-mann-kendall-tau-b-with-sen-s-method--enhanced-?focused=3795005&tab=function
- ReadDataFile.m reads the CSVs for both BuildKendallTauTable.m and DrawResidualVarFigs.m
