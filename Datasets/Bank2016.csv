#Bank et al 2016 PNAS dataset www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1612676113,,,,,,,
#Residus 585 and 588 and 589 have more than two alternative nucleotides but for the present purposes I've randomly chosen just two,,,,,,,
#To build this I started from the complete dataset and then sorted by values in columns representing larger cardinalities to quickly cut out the uwanted data,,,,,,,
#And the data are log-transformed as per our CODEG convention of transforming drug resistance and growth rate phenotypes,,,,,,,
