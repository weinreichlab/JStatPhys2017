# Mean is relative fitness = raw_mean divided by raw_mean of wildtype for CCR5,,,,,,,,
# These are the first 32 alleles as processed in daSilvaAlleles.xlsx in the adjacent ../Literature/da Silva pain folder,,,,,,,,
# Note that these mutations are numbered as per Fig 1 in da Silva. In particular these coordinates are not positions in the protein,,,,,,,,
