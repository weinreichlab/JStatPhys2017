# de Visser et al 2009 https://doi.org/10.1086/599081,,,,,,
# Mean and Var in log fitness computed by DMW using replicate data in Yinghong's json file derived from AmNat supplemental,,,,,,
# Those values were first pasted into deVisser2009.xlsx in the ../Literature folder and there processed as described next,,,,,,
# So that means first computing log of each replicate and then computing means and variances on those log-transformed data,,,,,,
# although I cant make the Franke 2011 dataset look like this one Jaspers paper says they used data from this paper,,,,,,
